# Experiment 1: Introduction to HTML & CSS

## Overview

This experiment focuses on understanding the basics of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). HTML is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and describes the structure of the content displayed in a web browser.

## Key Concepts

1. **HTML** is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
2. **HTML** stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**.
3. It defines the structure of a web page and its elements.
4. HTML consists of a series of elements, each telling the browser how to display specific types of content.
5. **HTML elements** are used to label parts of the content, such as:
    - **Headings** (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
    - **Paragraphs** (`<p>`)
    - **Links** (`<a>`), and more.

<!-- ## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the basic structure of an HTML document.
- Learn how HTML elements define and format content.
- Explore how web browsers interpret HTML code.

This experiment will give you a foundational understanding of how web pages are built using HTML and will prepare you for working with CSS to enhance web design in future experiments. -->
